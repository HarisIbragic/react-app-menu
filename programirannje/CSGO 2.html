		<p>The Next Era of Counter-Strike
		Counter-Strike 2 is the largest technical leap forward in Counter-Strike’s history, ensuring new features and updates for years to come.
		All of the game’s new features will be revealed when it officially launches this summer, but the road to Counter-Strike 2 will begin later today with a Limited Test for select CS:GO players. During this testing period, we’ll be evaluating a subset of features to shake out any issues before the worldwide release.
		Counter-Strike 2 arrives this summer as a free upgrade to CS:GO. So build your loadout, hone your skills, and prepare yourself for what’s next!

		Learn more about some of the features of the <a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2">CS2 Limited Test here</a>
